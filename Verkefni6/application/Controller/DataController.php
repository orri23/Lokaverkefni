/**
 * Class SongsController
 * This is a demo Controller class.
 *
 * If you want, you can use multiple Models or Controllers.
 *
 * Please note:
 * Don't use the same name for class and method, as this might trigger an (unintended) __construct of the class.
 * This is really weird behaviour, but documented here: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php
